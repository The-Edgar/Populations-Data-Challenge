# ELSA Product Analyst Challenge



A very important thing we do in ELSA is following user trends and patterns, so that we can quickly adapt our product to changes and new arising opportunities.



## Objective

Create a dashboard with meaningful insights for the given data, followed by an explanatory report.



## Tasks

* Download the data csv [from here](https://datahub.io/core/population-city/r/unsd-citypopulation-year-fm.csv)

* Clean and prepare the data in Python (can be a simple script or notebook)
* Choose the most relevant metrics and insights
* Create the dashboard, in a technology of your choice (Tableau, Google Data Studio, etc), presenting the chosen metrics
* Write a small report detailing any findings you deem important



## Data

The data is provided in a [csv file](https://datahub.io/core/population-city/r/unsd-citypopulation-year-fm.csv) and contains the population count for different countries and cities over some years. Data columns are self explanatory.



## Deliverables

* The cleaning and preparation Python code/script
